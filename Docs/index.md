## Welcome to the MoonCore Docs

Here you will be able to find guides on starting using MoonCore, articles on how to use the library properly and
a documented reference of all MoonCore services and helpers

> [!NOTE]  
> This documentation is still in a very early stage. The original repository this fork was made from had close to no documentation
> so it might take a bit getting to a good stage. All publicly exposed components already have xml documentation which is available
> in your IDE and the reference section of this page
